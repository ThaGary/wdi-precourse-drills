    <p>I am super excited to start my course at Galvanize. I have some knowledge with HTML and CSS but my JavaScript experience is very poor currently. Iâ€™m glad that I am attending this school that will teach me in a way that I can understand. My goals with coding is to learn how to make websites and applications professionally for a company. I want to work with a team of individuals that are enthusiastic about the project that we are given. Anywhere in the gaming or social media industry would be awesome. I have always been interested in making websites for my friends and broadcasters on Twitch for fun, but with this education opportunity I could code for a living too.</p>
